## 👶Bio

Haluka is a young entrepreneur. She opened a new media company with her former Thailand classmate.

She graduated from MIT and she has a broad connection with multiple small creative communities. **Compared to working under chain of command in big companies, she much preferred to work on self-oriented projects through collaboration with a small number of trusted people with mutual interests.**

Her focus is self-growth and discovery of new scopes. Naturally she desires self-managed work time flexibility and broader cross-disciplinary collaboration with different people.

As an entrepreneur, **her timetable is always changeable**, and she have to handle most chores in life and business on her own.

Her company has 2 core members and 3 outsource coders. She also has a couple of funders and clients.

### During her one day:

- she wakes up in the morning and then has a core meeting with her co-founder.
- In the morning she communicates with clients and funders: send emails, make calls and goes out to meet people.
- From afternoon to evening she sits in front of the computer to conceive new ideas and work on the projects.
- At night, she meets with outsource workers in another time zone and collaborates on projects.

## 🐱‍🏍Motivation

Haluka’s team shares Dropbox storing in-progress project files with co-founders and outsource coders to **keep track with everyone’s progress.**

Haluka’s team uses Dropbox to **store a complete package of files for a monumental benchmark** of business, such as presentation to investors, pre-exhibition check and hand-in to clients.

Haluka uses share link function in Google Drive to **give out (limited) project information to interested third parties**.

Haluka uses Dropbox and Google Sheet to ask everyone in the team to **fill up reimbursement forms**. Then she hands in a whole team form to her funder, receives modification requests from the latter and makes the final version.

## 🎡Goal

- **Back up a complete package of crucial project files at every benchmark.**
- **Keep track with every co-worker’s progress and make sure each person has access to necessary working files.**
- **Give out project information easily to interested third-party, at the same time control their access to core project files.**
- **Transfer forms that need to be filled up from one hand to another**

## 😫Frustrations

- Super **inefficient to wait for one person filling up the form** before transferring to another none. Yet if open access to everyone at the same time, authorities’ modification can’t be distinguished from filling trials of ordinary workers.
- **Lack of differentiation between documents** stored for self-use and documents stored because of others’ sharing. Can’t delete irrelevant files because of fear of messing up with the team's common back-up.
- **Small storage space** can be full very quickly because of others’ sharing.
- Occasionally **forget to upload files from local to shared cloud space.**
